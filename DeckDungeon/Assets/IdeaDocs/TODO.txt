	Gotta create a better way to do quests than to write a scriptable object for each quest specifically, or I can but feels like there has to be a better way without relying on some sort of scripting language


	Gotta do something with enemies turns so that way they can be destroyed mid turn and not fuck it up. So destroy as part of clean up maybe?
